/*
Question:
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, 
return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

/*
When passing a comparisonFunction, your comparisonFunction should take in
two elements a, b and return a positive number if a is greater than b,
a negative number if a is less than b, and 0 if a is equal to b.

For example, (a, b) => a - b works if we are just dealing with two numbers.
